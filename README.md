# RPi home environmental monitoring
## Introduction

This documents a home environmental monitoring project using Raspberry Pis and
anything else that fits.

## Documentation

In the `docs` directory you will find a `requirements.txt` and Sphinx
documentation. To install you will likely want to create a Python virtualenv,
activate it and then:

``` bash
    > pip install -r requirements.txt
    > make html
```

Documentation will be in `build/html/index.html`

## Source

All rather basic at the moment.
